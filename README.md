# CatPhotoApp

CatPhotoApp is a beginner-level web project designed to demonstrate fundamental HTML concepts.  
This project is part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum focused on learning web development basics.

## Overview

The application showcases the use of essential HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists to create a simple, structured web page.

**Additionally**, the project goes beyond the base requirements by implementing semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`), accessibility improvements (descriptive `alt` text, `figcaption`), and clean, maintainable code formatting.
